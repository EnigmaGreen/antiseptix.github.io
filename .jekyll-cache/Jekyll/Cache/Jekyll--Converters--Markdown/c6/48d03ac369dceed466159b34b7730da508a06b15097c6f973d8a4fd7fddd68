<p>Antiseptix is a Green Chemistry cleaning solution that is great for use on electronics, where traditionally alcohol or ammonia based cleaning solutions were used.</p>

<p>Antiseptix is a solution formed from a combination of water and salt. This combination creates a powerful yet safe and non-toxic biocidal solution that is extremely effective in breaking down dirt and grease— the perfect solution for cleaning electronics.</p>

<p>The primary benefits of Antiseptix include safety and effectiveness. It’s free from high levels of pH, harsh chemicals, aromatics, and caustic agents. It’s also non-corrosive and non-irritating to the skin, making it ideal for cleaning delicate electronics. Plus, it dries quickly and leaves no residue, allowing you to safely get back to work in no time.</p>

<p>In terms of effectiveness, Antiseptix is a powerful biocide that eliminates bacteria, mold, and fungi in only a few minutes. It does this by denaturing the proteins in organisms and rapidly disabling their enzymatic structures. Furthermore, it’s capable of breaking down complex oils and reducing grease quickly and easily.</p>

<p>It’s also important to note that HOCl is ideal for removing and preventing corrosion from metal surfaces. This is because it doesn’t strip away the metal like some harsh chemicals can do. Instead it actively cleans the surface without degrading its integrity.</p>

<p>For best results when cleaning your electronics with Antiseptix, make sure you use an appropriately sized applicator that won’t overwhelm your device and cause damage. You should also be sure to properly rinse off any remaining residue before allowing the device to dry.</p>

<p>Cleaning electronics with Antiseptix is a safe, non-toxic, and effective process that ensures premium performance and longevity of your devices.</p>
