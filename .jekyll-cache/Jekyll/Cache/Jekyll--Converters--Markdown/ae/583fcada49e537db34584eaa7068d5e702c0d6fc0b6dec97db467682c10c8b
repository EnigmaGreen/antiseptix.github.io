<p>There are several ways to use Antiseptix for cosmetic sanitisation. One common method is to use our spray bottle to and apply to the surface of cosmetics, such as makeup brushes, sponges, and applicators. The solution can be allowed to sit on the surface for a few minutes before being rinsed off with water. Another option is to use Antiseptix wipes. These can be used to quickly and easily disinfect cosmetics on the go.</p>

<p>It is important to follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions when using Antiseptix for cosmetic sanitisation, as the concentration of the solution may vary depending on the product application.</p>

<p>It is also a good idea to test the solution on a small, inconspicuous area of the cosmetic before using it on the entire item, as some products may be sensitive to Antiseptix. If you experience any irritation or other adverse reactions when using Antiseptix, stop using the product immediately and consult a healthcare professional.</p>
