<p>leaning and disinfecting are two important activities that help to maintain a clean and healthy environment, but they are not the same thing. Understanding the difference between cleaning and disinfecting is essential in order to effectively maintain a clean and safe environment.</p>

<p>Cleaning refers to the removal of dirt, dust, and other contaminants from surfaces and objects. This can be done using a variety of methods, including sweeping, dusting, wiping, and scrubbing. Cleaning is important because it removes visible dirt and grime, as well as allergens and other potentially harmful substances that can contribute to illness and allergic reactions.</p>

<p>Disinfecting, on the other hand, refers to the process of killing or inactivating microorganisms (such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi) on surfaces and objects. Disinfecting is often done after cleaning, as it is more effective when applied to a clean surface. Disinfecting is important because it helps to reduce the risk of illness by reducing the number of harmful microorganisms that may be present on surfaces and objects.</p>
