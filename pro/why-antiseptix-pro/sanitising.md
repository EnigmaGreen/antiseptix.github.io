The global pandemic has changed the way we think about our health and safety practices, with sanitising now at the forefront of our minds. Sanitising may sound like an overly complicated process, but it doesnâ€™t have to be. Here are some tips on how to properly sanitise your hands while at home.

## But what kind of sanitising agents should we use? 

Antiseptix is an effective solution for keeping our surfaces, and ourselves, safe and clean.  Our Antiseptix contains Hypochlorous acid (HOCL). HOCL is a naturally occurring chemical compound derived from salt and water. It's a type of chlorine that's used as a pesticide and biocide, so you can be sure it will hospital grade cleanliness when it comes to eliminating bacteria and germs.

As an active and natural disinfectant, Antiseptix sanitiser is non-toxic, non-irritating and gentle on our skin, making it safer for all members of the family. 

## So, how do you use Antiseptix as part of your safe sanitising habits? 

Firstly, you should start by making sure all surfaces are wiped down with a clean cloth or paper towel. Make sure the surface is free from any visible dirt or dust. Then, spray the surface with Antiseptix disinfectant. Allow to sit for at least ten minutes and then wipe away the excess solution with the same cloth or paper towel. 

When cleaning clothes or fabrics, hypochlorous acid can be added directly to the washing machine or hand-washed. You should follow the manufacturer's instructions on how much Antiseptix to add to the cycle. 

For yourself and your family, you can use Antiseptix as part of your daily hygiene routine. If you're worried about any germs that might still be lingering on your hands, spray them with our Antiseptix  sanitiser and make sure to leave it on for at least a minute before wiping it away. This will help to eliminate any lingering bacteria.

To maintain a healthy lifestyle, it's important to regularly clean and sanitise your surroundings. With Antiseptix products you can be sure of a hospital-grade clean.
